# Random but simple tailwindcss Templates

Welcome! This is a super straightforward admin dashboard template built with TailwindCSS and vanilla JavaScript. I made this because most dashboard templates out there try to cover every possible use case and end up feeling bloated or complicated. Sometimes, you just want something simple you can clone and start working on right away—so here it is.

## Features

- Clean, minimal layout
- Built entirely with TailwindCSS for easy customization
- No frameworks—just vanilla JS
- Quick to set up and modify for your own projects

## Why This Template?

Most existing templates try to be everything to everyone, which can make them hard to work with for small projects or quick prototypes. This template keeps things simple so you can focus on building your dashboard, not wrangling with unnecessary features.

## Pages
